    <h2 id="ERASER"> SECTION--06: ERASER</h2><br>
    <p>An eraser is one of the most basic and commonly used correction tools. It is mainly used to remove mistakes made with a pencil. Erasers are usually made of rubber or synthetic materials and work by gently rubbing away the graphite from the surface of the paper. A good-quality eraser removes writing smoothly without tearing or damaging the paper. Erasers are widely used by students, artists, and office workers, especially during exams, note-taking, and drawing work</p><br>

    <h2 id="CORRECTION FLUID">SECTION--07: CORRECTION FLUID</h2><br>
    <p>Correction fluid is a white liquid used to cover mistakes made with a pen. It is often called “white-out.” When a mistake is made, the fluid is applied over the incorrect text and allowed to dry for a short time. Once dry, it creates a white surface on which new writing can be done. Correction fluid is commonly used in offices, schools, and for official documents. However, it must be used carefully to avoid smudging or making the paper look untidy.</p><br>

    <h2 id="CORRECTION TAPE">SECTION--08: CORRECTION TAPE</h2><br>
    <p>Correction tape is a modern and convenient correction tool used to fix pen-written mistakes instantly. It comes in the form of a small dispenser containing a white tape. When the tape is rolled over the mistake, it covers the error neatly and allows immediate rewriting without waiting for it to dry. Correction tape is cleaner and faster than correction fluid, making it popular among students and professionals.</p><br>

    <h2 id=" PENCIL ERASER CAP">SECTION--09: PENCIL ERASER CAP</h2><br>
    <p>A pencil eraser cap is a small rubber eraser that fits over the end of a pencil. It is designed for quick and easy correction while writing. Because it stays attached to the pencil, there is less chance of losing it. Pencil eraser caps are especially useful for students, as they are convenient for correcting small mistakes during classroom work or exams.</p><br>
